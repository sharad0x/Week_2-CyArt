## 📁 Mini Projects

Each task folder includes its own `README.md`, source code, and relevant files.

### 1. 🔢 [Task1 - From Scratch Neural-Net Regression](./Task1)
Builds a basic feedforward neural network **from scratch using NumPy**, for a regression task. Includes:
- Forward/backward pass
- SGD optimizer
- Loss visualization
- Modular structure (`model.py`, `train.ipynb`, etc.)

### 2. 📊 [Task2 - NLTK-Powered Text Analytics Web App](./Task2)
A Streamlit-based web app for **text analytics using NLTK**:
- Tokenization, POS-tagging, N-gram analysis, sentiment scores
- Upload `.txt` files and dynamically analyze them
- Two pages: Data Explorer and Analysis Dashboard

### 3. ⏱️ [Task3 - High-Performance Time Series Transformations](./Task3)
Efficient transformations on large time-series datasets using **NumPy & pandas**:
- Rolling stats, EWMA, FFT
- Vectorized routines and benchmark results
- Deliverables: `timeseries_utils.py`, `benchmark.py`, CSV results

### 4. 🧼 [Task4 - Complex Data Munging & Statistical Modeling](./Task4)
Messy dataset cleaning and statistical modeling with **pandas & statsmodels**:
- Schema inference, type conversion, feature engineering
- Regression modeling using `statsmodels`
- Includes: `data_prep.ipynb`, `modeling.ipynb`, cleaned dataset, slide summary
